"1Because law enforcement can report up to three types of weapons/uses of force for each offense (up to ten) in an incident, some offenses may have been counted more than once to attribute them to each of the weapon types associated with them. Therefore, the figures in the table do not reflect the number of weapons or offenses reported in the related incidents.",,,,,,,,
2The Type of Weapon/Force Involved is collected through the National Incident-Based Reporting System for 8 offense categories comprised of 15 offense types. See the downloadable Methodology file for more information.,,,,,,,,
"3Homicide offenses must be reported with a specific weapon, so the category No Weapon/Force Involved is not applicable for these offenses.",,,,,,,,
